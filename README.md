👋 Hi, I’m Saviru Subasith Ferdinando, an Electrical & Electronic Engineering undergraduate building intelligent hardware systems that bridge electronics, software, and AI.

I specialize in Embedded Systems, PCB Design, IoT, Robotics, and Edge AI, transforming ideas into real-world engineering solutions — from schematic and firmware to deployment and testing.

My experience includes multi-layer PCB design, STM32/ESP32 firmware development, wireless IoT communication (LoRa/WiFi), and AI-powered computer vision systems. I build solutions that are not only functional, but reliable, efficient, and scalable.

🔹 Designed autonomous robots for national competitions
🔹 Built IoT environmental monitoring networks
🔹 Developed AI-based people counting & localization systems
🔹 Engineered precision measurement and embedded data acquisition devices

Tools & Technologies: C/C++, Python, Altium, KiCad, ESP32/STM32, OpenCV, MATLAB, LTspice, GitHub

Beyond engineering, I value leadership, teamwork, and resilience — strengthened through mentoring, competitions, chess, and outdoor adventures.

🚀 Currently seeking internship opportunities in Embedded Systems, IoT, Robotics, or AI-driven hardware development where I can contribute, learn, and build impactful solutions.

Let’s connect and collaborate.
